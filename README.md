## How to use

1. Log in using your CodingBat login credentials.
2. Select the problem set to view grades for.
3. Optionally, enter text into the filter field to filter by Memo.

## Tips

In order to easily filter students by class, have them enter a unique string in their Memo field that corresponds to their class/section. For example, a student in AP Computer Science A, section 3 could include [APCSA-3] in the memo field along with their name. For example, all of my students have memo fields in the following format:

    Lovelace, Ada [APCSA-3]
