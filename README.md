## Tips

In order to easily filter students by class, have them enter a string in their Memo field that corresponds to their class/section. For example, all of my students have Memo fields in the following formats:

    Babbage, Charles [APCSP-1]
    Lovelace, Ada [APCSA-3]
    Turing, Alan [APCSA-3]
    van Rossum, Guido [APCSA-6]
    Wozniak, Steve [APCSP-1]
